# ADT-implementation
Implementation of different abstract data types using C++

In this project the object is to implement abstract data types like **Queue**, **Stack** and etc. using template class and turn it to reusable library. The project serves mainly for learning purposes and potentially for practical purposes, hence the code was made open-source.

These objects consist of basic operations like:
1. Modifiers
2. Iterator
3. Access operators

## Ver 1.0
* So far the project contains the implementaion of several abstract data types: LinkedList, Queue, Stack.
* Even though most of the implementaion for these classes have been complete, these objects still missing some optimization that may potentially cause compile error, therefore code requires some further modification.
## Ver 1.5
